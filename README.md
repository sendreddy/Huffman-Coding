# Huffman Coding Project

## Overview

This project is a C++ application that implements Huffman coding. Huffman coding is a compression algorithm that is used to reduce the size of data without losing any information. The project includes a C++ source file that implements the required functionality.

## Features

- Implementation of Huffman coding for data compression.
- Encoding and decoding functionalities.

## Files

- `Project03.cpp`: The main C++ source file containing the implementation.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository and Compile the Project**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cpp-huffman-coding.git
   cd cpp-huffman-coding
   g++ Project03.cpp -o huffman_coding
  
2. **Run the application**
    ./huffman_coding
